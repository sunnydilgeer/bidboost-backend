    "description": "Northern Trains Limited ('NTL'), a Train Operating Company delivering passenger rail services across the North of England, is issuing this notice to establish a single-supplier framework agreement for the provision of European Train Control System ('ETCS') Train Driver Simulation Simulator Infrastructure and Services.\n\nNTL will act as the contracting authority and owner of this framework agreement. However, both NTL and the Participating Authorities named in this notice will be entitled to call off their respective requirements under the framework.\n\nThe scope of this procurement includes the purchase of ETCS Train Driver Simulation Simulator Infrastructure and Services to support driver training in preparation for the implementation of ETCS across the Northern network, scheduled for 2030 as part of the Transpennine Route Upgrade (TRU) programme.\n\nETCS is an industry driven programme aimed at standardising train control and signalling systems to enhance interoperability, safety, and operational efficiency across the rail network. Its introduction along the TRU corridor-connecting Manchester, Leeds, Huddersfield, and York-will have a significant impact NTL's operations. This transition will require rolling stock compatibility with the new signalling system and comprehensive driver retraining, affecting six traincrew depots and approximately 1,800 drivers.\n\nThe requirement for ETCS Train Driver Simulation Simulator Infrastructure and Services include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Portable Simulators, comprising:\n\nHardware: simulator station (e.g., screens, driving controls, DSD pedal, keyboard, mouse, headset, PC base unit, graphics card, cabling)\n\nSoftware: traction type for existing rolling stock as well as newly built trains\n\n- Simulator Control Stations: hardware & software\n\n- Admin Interface Station, including firewall & network interface equipment\n\n- Spare Parts Package\n\n- 36 month warranty for each simulator solution\n\n- Extended Maintenance & Warranty for subsequent years\n\n- CGI Route development\n\n- Multi-platform ETCS Application offering various training scenarios\n\nOptional items available under the framework may include:\n\n- Virtual Reality (VR) training headsets\n\n- ETCS traffic simulator workstations\n\n- Additional CGI route development (priced per mile and kilometers)\n\nIndicative volumes under this framework are expected to be:\n\n- 48 portable simulators in total (32 for NTL and 16 for TransPennine Trains Limited (\"TPT\"))\n\n- 16 simulator control stations in total (12 for NTL and 4 for TPT)\n\n- 2 admin interface stations (1 for NTL and 1 for TPT).\n\nThese volumes are estimates and may be subject to change prior to entering into individual work orders. No minimum purchase volumes are guaranteed under this framework agreement.\n\nThe indicative timings for delivery of the simulators are as follows: NTL - September 2027, TPT - January 2031. Other Participating Authorities may enter into their respective work orders at any point throughout the framework's duration.\n\nThe estimated total value of the framework is \u00a3100,000,000 across its whole duration (8 years). This value has been estimated by taking into account the potential demand from all Participating Authorities mentioned on this notice and is not solely based on the value of the initial expected volumes.\n\nNTL is procuring on behalf of the Participating Authorities (as more particularly defined below) and will enter into the relevant framework agreement with the successful supplier where such contract is awarded. The Participating Authorities (as more particularly defined below) are permitted to use the framework via subsequent work orders in accordance with section 1(3)(b) of the Procurement Act 2023. However, NTL is responsible for the conduct of the procurement throughout and all correspondence and communication from suppliers is to be solely with NTL.\n\nIn addition to NTL, the Participating Authorities who may call-off under this framework are:\n\n- the Train Operating Companies\n\n- Network Rail Infrastructure Limited\n\n- Any holders of a passenger licence or a station licence granted pursuant to section 8 of the Railways Act 1993 and/or a passenger licence granted pursuant to regulation 6 of the Railway (Licensing of Railway Undertakings) Regulations 2005\n\nWhere used throughout this notice, the meaning of Train Operating Companies includes all and any of those train operating companies who, currently or in the future, provide services for the carriage of passengers by railway:\n\na) under a franchise agreement with the Secretary of State within the meaning of section 23(3) of the Railways Act 1993 or\n\nb) under, or secured under, the Secretary of State's duty in section 30(1) of the Railways Act 1993; or\n\nc) in accordance with legislation which supersedes or amends the powers referred to in a) and b), including where such powers are transferred from the Secretary of State to another body.\n\nA list of some of the current providers of services for the carriage of passengers by railway under these provisions can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-register-of-rail passenger-contracts.\n\nThe framework agreement may be novated or assigned by NTL to Train Operating Companies, or to DFT Operator Limited (company number: 07141122) or any successor parent company to a Train Operating Company, following a corporate restructuring or similar circumstance.",

    "description": "Trivallis are procuring a development partner for our Penrhys Regeneration project. The partner will work with Trivallis to design and subsequently deliver a new housing development in Penrhys, invest in mixed-tenure housebuilding and manage all stages of the process from planning through to sales and after-care. Social value requirements will be included as part of the project and residents have been at the heart of the process, meeting with architects, planners and our team to shape the future of their community.\n\nPreliminary market engagement was undertaken in accordance with section 16(1) of the Procurement Act 2023. A Preliminary Market Engagement Notice was published on Sell2Wales on 6 August 2025. This notice provided for interested parties to register their interest via email. A briefing pack was made available which set out the context of the project, Trivallis' objectives and a number of supporting documents. A copy of the briefing pack is included in the Portal.\n\nA number of participants who registered interest also opted to join a call to discuss their feedback on the proposed process and the information provided. The feedback provided confirmed that the market generally did have the ability and appetite to deliver against Trivallis' minimum requirements and in line with the proposed commercial structure, as well as delivering added social value and engagement with local communities as part of the project.\n\nPhase one will deliver circa 120 new homes as part an exciting long-term plan for around 800-900 homes across the site.\n\nA key principle of the project is to adopt a tenure neutral approach to the delivery of new affordable homes and homes for sale. Trivallis will fund and retain the affordable housing units and the market housing properties will be funded and sold by the successful bidding organisation.\n\nThe estimated contract length is from week commencing 29th June 2026 to end of June 2036, with an estimated gross development value of \u00a3200,000,000 (two hundred million pounds). A contract extension allowance is made for up to 5 (five) years of incremental extensions, depending on the progression of the project.\n\nTrivallis will be using the competitive flexible procedure as it appears in the Procurement Act 2023 under section 20 (2) (b).\n\nThis competitive flexible procedure will be conducted in three (3) stages. The three (3) stages are described in more detail below.\n\nStage 1: Invitation to participate; this stage is to secure a credible shortlist of up to three potential partners.\n\nThis stage includes the Welsh procurement specific questionnaire (WPSQ) including conditions of participation and case study question requirements.\n\nStage 2: Invitation to submit initial proposals and dialogue\n\nThis stage will commence with the issuing of a letter inviting Suppliers that have been successfully shortlisted at stage 1 to submit their initial proposals, together with the issue of an overarching site wide development agreement. Contract documentation will be subject to discussion as part of the dialogue process.\n\nThe initial proposals will not be evaluated but will be a work in progress against each of the submission requirements. The initial proposals will be used to inform discussions. Trivallis will hold up to two sessions with each bidder to discuss initial proposals aligned with the assessment methodology and award criteria set out in in Appendix 7 of the Tender Document. A presentation to tenant representatives will also be required. Feedback will be provided by the Trivallis evaluation team to enable Suppliers to refine their submissions. A session will also be offered to discuss commercial principles.\n\nStage 3 Invitation to submit a final tender:\n\nWhen Trivallis confirms that the dialogue sessions are closed, Suppliers will be informed via Etender Wales and will be requested to submit their final tender response proposals.\n\nFinal tenders must be submitted in accordance with the timetable and instructions set out in the Tender Document and any additional information provided. Once the assessment has concluded, Trivallis will provide an assessment summary to all Suppliers that submitted final tenders.\n\nContract award is subject to the formal approval process of Trivallis. Until all necessary approvals are obtained and the steps below completed to Trivallis' satisfaction, no Contract(s) will be entered into.\n\nContracting for the whole project and how this will be managed can be found in Clause 11 Contract Terms in the Tender Document.\n\nThe full procurement indicative timetable can be found in the Tender Document via Etender wales.\n\nPlease note that the deadlines contained in this notice are for Stage 1.The full indicative timetable, for all stages, is in the Tender Document.",

Technical aspect - to design and test a scalable proof-of-concept data pipeline and associated reporting capability.\n\n2. Cultural aspect - to assess and strengthen the organisation's data culture, readiness, and capability to adopt and sustain that pipeline.\n\nWe are exploring whether one supplier can deliver both aspects effectively, or whether partnerships or consortia may offer the best route.\n\nIndicative Scope\n\nTechnical aspect\n\n\u2022 Design, build, and test a secure, automated data pipeline within a Microsoft Azure environment.\n\n\u2022 Ingest and transform data from multiple formats and sources (e.g., Excel, SQL, APIs, SharePoint).\n\n\u2022 Develop a defined \"use case\" to demonstrate actionable insight (e.g., grant allocation, participation, or facility data).\n\n\u2022 Produce dashboards or visualisations (e.g., Power BI) and document the process for repeatability and scalability.\n\n\u2022 Transfer knowledge and build capability within Sport Wales through a \"show and do\" approach.\n\nCultural aspect\n\n\u2022 Assess Sport Wales' readiness and capability to adopt and embed data-driven ways of working.\n\n\u2022 Explore barriers and enablers to consistent data use (skills, ownership, processes, governance).\n\n\u2022 Recommend practical interventions to strengthen data literacy, governance, and culture.\n\n\u2022 Develop a roadmap and change plan for long-term adoption and capability building.\n\n\u2022 Work collaboratively with the project team to ensure findings are actionable and grounded in organisational context.\n\nKey Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the Alpha phase, Sport Wales expects to:\n\n\u2022 Have a functioning, demonstrable proof-of-concept pipeline delivering insight from at two or more key datasets.\n\n\u2022 Understand the organisational changes, skills, and processes needed to scale that pipeline.\n\n\u2022 Have a clear roadmap for a Beta phase and long-term implementation.",

    "description": "Northumbria University is launching a bold and innovative digital transformation programme centred on the implementation of SMART cards and advanced identity management. This initiative is designed to strengthen our identification capabilities improving the wider user experience and is to be driven by the adoption of a cutting-edge approach supported by market-leading technology. This strategic investment will replace the University's outdated ImageBase system (introduced in 2015) and photo uploader (introduced in 2006), which no longer support the university's operational, security or digital transformation needs.\n\nThe current anticipated project approach is to deliver a modern, cloud-native identity and credential management solution to support around 7,000 staff, 77,000 student accounts and a wide range of visitors across our campuses. As a minimum, the solution must enable secure identity verification, smartcard issuance and management and integrate smoothly with the University's established Joiners, Movers, and Leavers (JML) processes.\n\nIdentified key deliverables that will form part of this requirement include (but is not limited to):\n\n\u2022Cloud solutions replacing Smartcard system (ImageBase) and Identity application (MIM).\n\n\u2022Mobile-friendly platform for photo capture and validation, replacing the legacy photo uploader.\n\n\u2022Transition from Mifare Classic 1K to a secure credential card storage such as Mifare DESFire EV3.\n\n\u2022Smooth interoperability with key business applications such as SITS, Oracle HCM, Entra, ADFS, PACOM and other student and library systems.\n\n\u2022Architecture designed to support mobile credentials and future digital identity options and centralised dashboard for card issuance, usage tracking, and operational reporting.\n\n\u2022Cyber secure offerings to align to National Cyber Security Centres Cyber Assessment Framework\n\nPrior to commencing formal procurement, we are engaging the market to:\n\n\u2022Deepen and confirm our understanding of the wider opportunity, showcasing best practice in deploying new technology while meeting the key deliverables outlined above as well as any mandatory and statutory requirements, placing user experience at the core of the solution.\n\n\u2022Define and evolve our requirements beyond key deliverables by leveraging industry best practice and supplier insight to deliver a solution that surpasses conventional approaches to identity management.\n\n\u2022Gather insight into indicative commercial models, potential delivery timelines and the critical internal enablers necessary to ensure the programme's success.\n\n\u2022Draw on supplier expertise in implementing scalable technology solutions for organisations with comparable scale and complexity.\n\n\u2022Expand our understanding on how current hardware could be retained or repurposed.\n\n\u2022Explore potential delivery models that follow a phased approach beginning with strategic advisory and progressing through design, delivery and implementation.\n\nBy engaging suppliers at this early stage, we aim to harness market insight to help inform and shape our future requirements. This approach is designed to support a fair, competitive and effective tender process, ensuring we identify the right supplier to successfully deliver the programme.\n\nFurther information relating to this PME opportunity are available via our Delta eSourcing platform:\n\nhttps://login.bipsolutions.com/casDelta/login?service=https://neupc.delta-esourcing.com/delta/j_spring_cas_security_check\n\nAccess Code: 4S99HAJH85\n\nTo access the platform, please copy and paste the URL into your browser.

It is envisaged this would potentially include battery storage if considered appropriate and advantageous. The Council is open to proposals on potential end users of the electricity created. The Council is also open to considering alternative models in respect of both length of term and the end users, and this would include funded and non-funded options.\n\nThe Queslett landfill site extends to approximately 45 acres, but not all of this may be developable, due to Nature Conservation requirements and the topography of the site. It is thought that up to one third of the site may be capable of being developed, subject to survey. A survey of the site and potential grid connections is being undertaken by the Council's technical advisers and will be made available to potential suppliers at tender stage.",

    "description": "Contract Award Notice to commence 8-working day standstill period before entering into a contract with Ipsos (market research) Limited to deliver the Data Collection requirements for the Survey-based Study of the 2026 Senedd Election.\n\nThe Senedd election is scheduled to take place by May 7th, 2026. In order to study this election, the project academic leadership team are leading a survey-based research project seeking to capture and disseminate representative data on Welsh voters' attitudes, behaviours, and socio-demographic attributes (including an enhanced focus on the themes of 'place, power, and political engagement').\n\nThe wider project toward which this work will contribute is entitled 'The 2026 Welsh Election Study: Place, Power, and Political Engagement'\n\nAs a result of this procurement process, Swansea University wish to award this contract to Ipsos (market research) Limited to undertake a series of representative sample survey waves of the Welsh electorate, encompassing one pre-campaign wave, one in-campaign wave, and one post-campaign wave.\n\nThe overarching aim of the WES 2026 Survey is to implement a high-quality data collection strategy to capture voters' attitudes and behaviours pre-election, during the campaign, and after the Senedd election in May 2026, resulting in a cutting-edge public opinion data resource that is, as far as possible, robust, representative, and generalisable for inference about the Welsh electorate.\n\nThe research team has identified push-to-web as the representative sampling methodology that they will deploy. A clear, granular account is required of how this approach will be rolled out to deliver 3 x representative samples across the project timetable. A minimum n of 2,000 is stipulated for each survey wave, but the approach is one that prioritises data quality over quantity. As such, an emphasis is sought on the survey frame coverage, on the randomisation of selection, and on the protocols to secure a 20% plus response rate, as well as the generation of survey data weights. In addition and as stipulated above, an approach is also sought to the provision of anonymized respondent location data using the ONS Output Areas system.\n\nThe project is funded by UK Research and Innovation's (UKRI) Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). WES 2026 is part of a UK-wide set of national election studies, and its work supports the delivery of ESRC's data infrastructure strategy.\n\nThe total maximum budget for this work was \u00a3368,000.00 (inclusive of VAT, all Welsh language translation & all expenses)\n\nThis tender was conducted electronically via etenderwales BravoSolution, in project 31576 and itt 119846 and the contract will run from November 2025 to November 2026.",

The Council has secured Funding from the 'All Wales Play opportunities Grant 2025-26. Capital grant for play spaces and playgrounds'. Tenders are sought from experienced contractors to design and implement works to upgrade the existing play area, which is in poor condition.\n\nThe existing play area is set within Parks land adjacent to an existing MUGA. The site currently comprises of swings, a roundabout, a springy animal and a climbing unit. The area is well used by children from Palmerston Primary School. After consultancy exercises with the school, it was noted that the children would like accessible play equipment.\n\nThe site itself can suffer from ground water flooding in low lying areas, so it will be necessary for all equipment to be installed at a similar or higher level than the adjacent pathway. There is one area in particular that floods and is highlighted in the attached appendices.\n\nIdeally the play equipment is to be grouped together so that it can be accessed from the pathways and from item to item. If the new area of surfacing for the new play equipment is greater than 100m2 over and above the existing surfacing, SUDS approval will be required. We require the contractor to suggest proposed drainage; the client will apply for the SUDS necessary.\n\nItems of equipment should not be above 4ms high. If this is the case Planning permission will not be required.\n\nTenders are sought from experienced contractors to design and implement works to upgrade the play area. The scope of the work s includes the following activities: -\n\n\u2022 Design of new play area.\n\n\u2022 Removal of existing play equipment, surfacing and site furniture. (See Appendices).\n\n\u2022 Supply and installation of new play equipment, surfacing, site furniture and any other works to complete the approved scheme.\n\n\u2022 Provide access track for vehicles to the site to stop damage to fields. (As necessary, See Appendices).\n\n\u2022 Be free draining if possible and comply with SAB legislation if applicable\n\n\u2022 Reinstatement of site as necessary.\n\nAll works must be undertaken in accordance with the Council's brief and drawing supplied and approved by the Contractor.",

    "description": "Domestic abuse is a serious issue, both nationally and locally. The complex nature of domestic abuse and the associated harm and inequalities it creates - including mental and physical ill health, homelessness and unemployment - has a drastic, negative and long-lasting impact upon the safety, health and wider life chances of families.\n\nThe Trust's vision is to build a Trust that provides excellent social work and family support for and with the city's most vulnerable children, young people and families.\n\nThe commissioned service will work with between 5 and 10 families affected by domestic abuse by providing intensive support over a period of up to two years. The expectation is that the Provider will work with the whole family including survivors, perpetrators, children and the wider family support network. The Provider will support in reducing domestic abuse in Birmingham and will ensure that the needs of children are being met in the home.\n\nFamilies will be identified during mobilisation and, once consent has been sought, information will be shared with the successful Provider within the first week of the contract. It is expected that the Provider will review the shared information around suitability and work will begin with families within the third week of the contract.\n\nThe Provider is expected to engage in transparent and collaborative discussions with the Trust to determine the appropriate level of support for each family. Should it be assessed that a family does not require intensive intervention and the service is therefore deemed unsuitable, the Provider will promptly commence work with a new family.\n\nThe work will be evaluated for impact and outcomes for the family.\n\nService activity\n\n\u2022 work with families identified by the Trust\n\n\u2022 provide intensive support to families for up to two years (minimum of one session per week initially (the ongoing level of appropriate contact can be discussed with the social worker) and become the lead professional for the family at the appropriate time\n\n\u2022 provide weekly written progress updates to the allocated social worker and attend and actively participate in Child In Need (CIN) / Child Protection (CP) / core group meetings where appropriate /multi-disciplinary case supervision\n\n\u2022 evidence how risk is assessed and managed in safety planning throughout the duration of involvement with the family\n\n\u2022 escalate immediate safety concerns to the allocated social worker\n\n\u2022 refer to other specialist services where appropriate\n\n\u2022 provide comprehensive exit strategies to families at the point of closure\n\n\u2022 provide support to families in stepping down to universal services\n\n\u2022 support in the prevention of non-family care arrangements\n\nThis service is a pilot, and the duration of the contract will initially be two years with the potential to extend for two years (1 + 1), beginning 2nd February 2026. The contract will be reviewed on an annual basis with a break clause after January 2027, and each subsequent year; with the continuation of the contract based on funding availability and performance.\n\nA Planned Procurement Notice was published on 01 October 2025 (Publication reference: 2025/S 000-061384)\n\nThe Trust will be using its free to use e-tendering system (in-tend) for the administration of this procurement process and potential suppliers must register with the system to be able to express an interest.

    "description": "The BEEMS (British Energy Estuarine and Marine Studies) programme is funded by NNB Generation Company (HPC) Limited and Sizewell C Limited. Through this programme, Cefas provide authoritative scientific information on the marine and transitional waters in the vicinity of potential nuclear new build (NNB) power stations and require a competent Supplier to deliver the element described below.\n\nWithin the BEEMS programme, Cefas routinely manage, review, analyse and report on hydrographic surveys conducted by third parties to meet regulatory marine environmental monitoring requirements.\n\nSurveys serve a range of purposes within the marine environmental monitoring programmes for Sizewell C (SZC) and Hinkley Point C (HPC) power stations. This includes bathymetric multibeam echosounder (MBES) surveys to examine:\n\n\u2022 Geomorphological change of nearshore bars and sandbanks (including validation of remote x-band radar measurements of these features).\n\n\u2022 Seabed change in dredging areas and dredge disposal sites.\n\n\u2022 Scour around seabed infrastructure.\n\nRequirement:\n\nThe Supplier will provide hydrographic services; covering specialist technical review and quality assurance of nearshore hydrographic survey data. Surveys are conducted by third parties as part of the marine environmental monitoring programmes for HPC and SZC NNB power stations. The work will be ongoing in nature, with an expected increase in survey activity in 2026. The projects are in varying stages of planning and as such, the Supplier could be required to take on work at any point in the project lifecycle. A kick off meeting will be held to discuss and agree the anticipated work requirement for each project.\n\nThe survey schedule is subject to change in accordance with weather, construction schedules and regulatory requirements. For SZC, surveys are expected to be at least quarterly throughout 2026 and likely to be similar in future years. For HPC there is no defined survey plan, but it is important that the Supplier can provide the required support as and when required.\n\nFull details of the requirement can be found in the Bidder Pack.\n\nContract Details\n\nDue to the nature of the work and the tight regulatory deadlines required to be met, the tendering process seeks to determine the Most Advantageous Tender (MAT) to award a Core Contract and up to 2 (two) Call-Off Contracts.\n\nThe Supplier awarded the Core Contract will be contracted with the intention to deliver all Contract requirements for the duration of the Contract and any possible extensions. The Buyer also intends to award up to 2 (two) additional Call-Off Contracts to the Tenderers ranked in the next 2 (two) positions (2nd and 3rd) below the Most Advantageous Tender.\n\nA Call-Off Contract will be used only in circumstances where the Core Contracted Supplier cannot provide the services. The Call-Off Contracted Suppliers will be approached in order of their ranked position (2nd, 3rd) from the evaluation process, to request provision of the required services.\n\nThe Core Contract will be awarded on a call-off basis, up to a maximum value of \u00a3100,000 including VAT. Actual value is dependent on the work required.\n\nThe additional Call-Off Contracts will be awarded based on no committed value or volume of work. Suppliers should understand that the Buyer may not award any work under the Call-Off Contract.\n\nAs the requirement is for work related to two different customers and sites, under the BEEMS programme, two sets of Terms and Conditions are applicable, and the Supplier is required to sign both Contracts.\n\nFor all work completed in relation to Sizewell C, the CEFAS25-97 BEEMS Sizewell C Short Form Contract Below Threshold will apply and for all work related to Hinkley Point C, CEFAS25-97 BEEMS Hinkley Point Short Form Contract Below Threshold will apply.",

    "publishing_authority": "Ministry of Defence",
    "notice_id": "",
    "published_date": "",
    "reference": "",
    "description": "Purpose and Context\n\nThe Ministry of Defence's (MOD) Defence Nuclear Organisation (DNO), referred to as \"the Authority,\" is seeking delivery partner(s) to support the Nuclear Sector Skills Team (NSST) in delivering specific projects that form part of the overarching Nuclear Skills Plan (NSP). These projects are critical to addressing the skills challenge across the UK's civil and defence nuclear sectors and ensuring the workforce is equipped to meet current and future demands.\n\nBackground to the Requirement\n\nIn August 2023, the Nuclear Sector Skills Team (NSST), formerly the Nuclear Skills Taskforce, was established to accelerate progress on nuclear workforce development. It brought together government, academia, and employers from across the civil and defence sectors to build on existing initiatives and drive a coordinated, multi-level action plan. Following extensive engagement with over 90 key stakeholders and a diagnostic exercise spanning more than 20 workstreams, the NSST produced two key outputs:\n\n- The Nuclear Skills Charter, signed by CEOs (or equivalents) of all Nuclear Skills Executive Committee (NSEC) member organisations, securing cross-sector commitment to the NSP's actions and deliverables.\n\n- The Nuclear Skills Plan (NSP), a ten-year, costed programme detailing the activities, governance structures, and collaborative behaviours required to generate the skills needed to meet the sector's growing demand. Further information on the NSP and its strategic context can be found at: http://nuclearskillsplan.com.\n\nLaunched on 15 May 2024, the NSP builds on the Defence Nuclear Command Plan and aligns with the Government's July 2024 policy intent to secure skills, jobs, growth, and social value across the UK. It supports both public and private investment in the nuclear workforce and underpins the ambition to create up to 40,000 new jobs by 2030.\n\nDelivery and Governance\n\nDelivery of the NSP began in May 2024, initiating an enabling phase through to March 2025. During this period, a suite of strategic requirements was developed to support sector-specific national priorities.\n\nThe NSST-a hybrid team comprising representatives from MOD, the Department for Energy and Net Zero (DESNZ), and Nuclear Skills Executive Council (NSEC) organisations-is responsible for mobilising the required contracts. As NSST is not a recognised contracting authority, the MOD acts in that capacity for this competitive tender via the DNO.\n\nScope of Tender\n\nThis document outlines the requirements for prospective delivery partners to support the NSST in executing defined work packages under the NSP. These 9 packages are designed to deliver tangible outcomes aligned with the NSP's strategic objectives, including workforce development, skills pipeline enhancement, and cross-sector collaboration. The Authority is seeking tender responses to the requirements in two stages:\n\nStage one: The NSST is seeking expressions of interest, via the completion of the Procurement Specific Questionnaire (PSQ), from Potential Providers to deliver the Nuclear Skills Plan detailed in this tender notice.\n\nStage two: Following evaluation of PSQ responses, up to four Potential Providers shall be invited to the full Invitation to Tender (ITT) stage for each Lot. Further details are provided below.\n\nFurther information regarding the scope of each work package can be found in the Statement of Requirements (SORs).\n\nPlease note that any incumbent Potential Provider that has been shortlisted to participate in the ITT will be required sign the Ethical Walls Agreement. Failure to do so may result in the Potential Provider being excluded from further participation in the procurement process.\n\nThe documents made available to Potential Providers via the Defence Sourcing Portal are;\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ Guidance-O.\n\nNote: an updated version of this document is now available, titled 20251107_715655461_PSQ Guidance_Rev1-O\n\n20251020_715655461 _Appendix 1_PSQ Guidance-O\n\n20251020_715655461_Appendix 2_PSQ Technical Questions-O\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ_Certificate of Performance-O\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ Information Firewall Statement-O\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ_Conflict of Interest Declaration Form-O\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ_Similar Contracts Previous 3 Years-O\n\n20251020_715655461_PSQ Explainer for Potential Providers-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ PSQ Technical Response Template -O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot_1_SOR_Destination Nuclear Marketing Campaign and Website-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 2_SOR_Bursaries-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 3_SOR_Nuclear Sponsorship Scheme-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 4_SOR_Sector Experts into Training-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 5_SOR_Career Switchers-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 6_SOR_Skills Supply Demand Model-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 7_SOR_Roles Pathways and Curriculum-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 8_SOR_Training Provider Network-O\n\n20251020_715655461_ Lot 9_SOR_Teacher Training Bursary-O\n\nIn order to access these documents Potential Providers will need to register for Find a Tender, the Central Digital Platform (CDP).
