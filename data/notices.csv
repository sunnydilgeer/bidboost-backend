Mexico currently lacks comprehensive, actionable assessments of high-potential sites and tailored regulatory models to de-risk investments, streamline permitting, and integrate OSW into national energy planning. This gap hinders the diversification of renewable energy sources, delays the energy transition, and limits contributions to Mexico's long-term climate commitments under NDC 3.0 and net zero targets.
To address these gaps, the proposed intervention seeks to support Mexico's Ministry of Energy (SENER) by identifying and evaluating high-potential OSW locations along Mexico's coastlines (the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coast), leveraging prior studies for more detailed analysis, and identifying relevant policies, regulations, and incentives to develop the OSW industry.

This intervention supports the Mexican Ministry of Energy (SENER) in advancing its offshore wind energy agenda through two strands: 
(1)	Conducting a preliminary technical and regulatory feasibility assessment for at least two potential offshore wind sites in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific coast, aligned with the ""Polos de Desarrollo"" (development poles)
(2)	Mapping the United Kingdom's regulatory framework for offshore wind to inform Mexico's regulatory development and accelerate project deployment.

The primary objective of this initiative is to expand the agricultural scope of the ""No Deforestation"" platform by integrating and rigorously validating georeferenced data from producer registries. In parallel, the project will design and implement a comprehensive dispute resolution mechanism to address user concerns and enhance the credibility of the platform's outputs.

Key technical challenges to be addressed include:
• Differentiating land uses such as agroforestry crops
• Capturing increases in shrub and tree cover from revegetation or reforestation on cultivated or grazed lands
• Ensuring interoperability with other AGRICULTURA applications and institutional systems
The project aims to improve land use traceability and establish a formal dispute resolution mechanism, both of which will contribute to reducing deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector. These outcomes will be underpinned by transparent, data-driven governance frameworks that support evidence-based decision-making.

Mexico is facing the challenge of increasing its climate ambition to fulfil its international commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. To implement its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), the country requires robust policy instruments such as climate governance reforms, carbon pricing mechanisms, an emissions trading system (ETS), and a national strategy for electric mobility. 
To ensure effective implementation, Mexico's Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) has requested the deployment of four embedded experts for 12 months.
This intervention supports the development and operationalisation of these tools, including updates to the National Climate Change System (SINACC), the ETS, the National Offsets Programme, and the Electric Mobility Strategy all aimed at strengthening climate governance and enabling a low-carbon, resilient economy.

The intervention will provide specialised technical inputs to:
•Strengthening SINACC's subnational collaboration, enabling more effective multi-level climate governance. 
•Supporting the design and operationalisation of Phase 1 of the Regulated Emissions Trading System, ensuring robust monitoring, compliance, and market mechanisms. 
•Develop the crediting mechanism for the Mexican National Offsets Programme, ensuring transparency, integrity, and alignment with international best practices.

The UK Space Industrial Plan (2024) identified ISAM as one of five key space capability areas for prioritisation, reflecting its importance to the nation's future in space. In addition, the Strategic Defence Review (2025) highlighted the need to develop Space Control capabilities, and by extension ISAM technologies, to defend UK space assets in an increasingly contested domain.

Recent years have seen significant progress in establishing the foundations of the UK space sector, with national and defence space strategies now complemented by detailed capability plans. Realising the UK's ambitions for ISAM will require close collaboration between government and industry, with future interventions guided by robust evidence.

To support this, UKSA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to organisations - both UK-based and international - developing or planning to develop ISAM payloads or technologies seeking flight opportunities as hosted payloads or on In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) missions. The aim is to map the landscape of new technologies seeking flight demonstration within the next 3-5 years.

Insights gathered through this RFI will inform UKSA's approach to in-space technology qualification and deepen our understanding of the evolving space technology landscape. We welcome your responses and appreciate your valuable input in shaping the future of the UK's ISAM capabilities.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is inviting tenders for the provision of Court Appointed Intermediary Services (CAIS), to support vulnerable defendants in the criminal jurisdiction and vulnerable parties and witnesses in the civil, family and tribunal jurisdictions. These services will be provided in courts and tribunals in England and Wales and tribunals in Scotland.

Intermediaries facilitate impartial communication to enable complete, coherent and accurate communication between vulnerable people and the courts/tribunals. Intermediaries may be instructed to provide an assessment of a person&apos;s communication needs, and provide recommendations on measures that could be put in place by the court to support vulnerable people, young people, children and other individuals who may need assistance during court proceedings. The intermediary may also be required to attend hearings to provide such assistance and support.

For the avoidance of doubt, the MoJ is only seeking tenders in relation to intermediary services that currently fall outside the remit of the MoJ Witness Intermediary Scheme (MoJ WIS). All requests for intermediary support for witnesses in criminal cases will continue to be managed via the MoJ WIS.",,,"North East,North West,Yorkshire and The Humber,East Midlands,West Midlands,East of England,London,South East,South West,Scotland,Wales","75231100 ",Commercial,CommercialIntermediaries@justice.gov.uk,"102 Petty France",,London,"SW1H 9AJ",England,,,,,"The MoJ invites tenders for Court Appointed Intermediary Services to support two existing framework agreements: the Managed & Approved Service Provider framework (MASP), and the Approved Service Provider framework (ASP).

The ASP framework seeks experienced and qualified intermediaries to support bookings on demand.

There is no limit to the number of service providers awarded a place on either framework, however a service provider may not hold a place on both the MASP and ASP frameworks simultaneously.

The MoJ is managing this procurement in accordance with its general obligations under UK law and specifically in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCRs) and the Light Touch Regime contained within Regulations 74 to 77.

The Public Sector AI (PSAI) Directorate within the Department of Science, Innovation 
and Technology (DSIT) exists to help the government make brilliant public services that 
empower people in the UK. We work at the very centre of government to drive digital
transformation focused on user needs and to reimagine how government uses AI to 
deliver public services and initiatives. 

The newly established Government Efficiency Accelerator (GEA) programme is a 
flagship initiative aimed at driving operational efficiencies across some of the 
government's key enabling functions (Finance, Policy, HR) through the safe and 
responsible adoption of AI. The GEA is working in collaboration with the GCF 
Commercial Innovation Hub (CIH) to better understand the availability of AI based 
solutions that can be used by teams across government departments to drive efficiency 
and increase productivity. 

The goal of this Pathfinder Project is to engage with the market to understand current 
capabilities, initially focusing on three core business areas: Finance, HR and policy 
(more details on a specific problem area below). 

Applicants should note that this engagement is not intended to lead to the procurement 
of a particular solution for DSIT or any other UK Government Department. Rather, we 
are looking to build a catalogue of tested and ""kitemarked"" products that will be made 
available to public sector organisations to consider procuring them in the knowledge 
that they have been tested and will meet requirements such as security, usability, 
transparency etc.

We are interested in hearing from all types of suppliers and would particularly 
encourage SMEs and VCSEs to submit proposals.


Challenge Summary:

As noted above, the GEA and CIH are engaging with the market to build a deeper 
understanding of how AI based solutions and products can help make government 
departments more efficient and productive. We appreciate there are a multitude of 
potential use cases so for this initial engagement we have chosen to focus on problems 
relating to budgeting and workforce forecasting. 

We are inviting suppliers to submit proposals outlining how their products could be 
used by finance teams across UK government departments in a safe, transparent and 
unbiased way. We are keen to explore solutions which can reduce the level of repetitive 
tasks required specifically when budgeting and conducting workforce forecasting. 
Submissions should demonstrate how the solution can streamline tasks, improve 
accuracy, and shorten time spent on repetitive work in order to free colleagues up to 
complete higher-value work. 

There is no fixed scope, as we aim for platform-agnostic, AI driven and innovative tools 
that adapt to various organisational needs. Solution should be accessible to 
organisations of all sizes and is not dependent on any specific ERP platform.",,,"Any region","72000000 ",,cih@dsit.gov.uk,"Trinity Bridge House",,Salford,"M3 5BS",England,,,"GEA Pathfinder Application Form.docx GEA Pathfinder Challenge Statement.pdf ",,,01/01/1,01/01/1,13/11/2025,NO,,Yes,Yes,No,,,,,,,,,," ",

The aim of the Lifelong Learning Entitlement (LLE) evaluation is to assess how well LLE has met its objectives; it will provide analysis and commentary on the success and effectiveness of the LLE and determine whether the intervention was well-targeted, cost-effective, whether desired outcomes have been achieved, and examine any unintended consequences. Data and evidence will also inform the benefits management case and the post-implementation review in academic year (AY) 31/32.

The evaluation will feature impact, process, and value for money (VfM) approaches. For the first 6 years (academic year (AY) 26/27- 31/32) the evaluation will conduct a process and theory-based impact evaluation, before carrying out VfM analysis in AY 36/37. In AY 31/32 a separate feasibility study will be commissioned to assess the possibility of quasi-experimental (QE) methods to measure the impact of LLE on learners, which, if possible, would be conducted in AY 36/37.  

Initially, the DfE would like to let a contract for a theory-based impact evaluation (TBIE) and process evaluation of the LLE.  The process evaluation will give insight on the implementation of LLE, the successes and challenges of delivery and lessons learnt from the perspective of learners, providers, the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Office for Students (OfS) and DfE colleagues. A mixed methods approach drawing on DfE administrative datasets and primary research will enable this. 

Similarly, the TBIE will use mixed methods and DfE administrative datasets and primary research to test both causal claims within the theory of change (ToC) and the alternative theories generated. This will enable an assessment of the contribution that LLE has made to measured outcomes.

tender_459958/1404422,Contract,"Ministry of Defence",Open,2024-09-13T15:43:16+01:00,"Nuclear Deterrence Fund","The UKs independent nuclear deterrent has existed for over 60 years to deter the most extreme threats to our national security and way of life, and that of our NATO Allies. UK nuclear policymakers will be confronted with an array of challenges in the coming decades, including from major nuclear armed states, emerging nuclear states and state-sponsored nuclear terrorism. The complexity and breadth of these challenges requires the UK to consider how to adapt its approach to deterrence across the spectrum of conflict, including nuclear and strategic deterrence. This, in turn, requires an intellectual capability that can assist UK policymakers in understanding the new security dynamic and its implications for future deterrence requirements.
The MoD is committed to not only developing this expertise within Government, but through a thriving and robust civil society which can provide valuable research and challenge to Government on these issues. The Nuclear Deterrence Fund (NDF) is a £3.3m pilot programme which will run between FY24-27 to stimulate wider UK expertise in nuclear deterrence issues and to generate a research base to support nuclear deterrence policymaking. 

The Fund is now accepting proposals. The deadlines for the September 2025 round of applications are as follows:

Supplier Registration on DSP and PQQ Submission Deadline
23:59hrs (BST) 26/08/2025 

Project Proposal Submission & Contract Terms Acceptance Deadline
12:00hrs (BST) 15/09/2025 

Programme Board Meeting
Postponed until 10th November 2025 due to sickness (this is subject to change)


(Please note that the Nuclear Deterrence Fund reserves the right to change these dates and will stop accepting applications once all funds have been allocated.)


To submit proposals to the NDF, suppliers must register for the NDF PQQ on the Defence Sourcing Portal (DSP). Once the necessary checks have been completed, suppliers will be onboarded onto a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) which will provide the contractual terms. Suppliers can onboard onto the DPS between 09/24 and 01/27. Once on the DPS, suppliers can submit research project proposals for consideration.

The contract will be let under a JCT Design & Build Contract (Minor Works 2024).

To the best of WTC's knowledge neither site requires planning permission for the refurbishment works to be undertaken. A site visit day has been arranged for 11 a.m on 31 October 2025 and the process for questions and clarifications is described within this document.
To assist tenderers WTC has undertaken full Mechanical & Electrical surveys of both sites and these reports are included within the Tender.
Companies should also be aware that the Warminster Road public toilet has an asbestos pipe to the rear of the structure that requires safe removal and disposal, in accordance with industry standards and practice. Following professional advice, WTC believes this is the only occurrence at the two sites though it is the successful tenderers responsibility to check this, and if additional asbestos is found arrange for its safe removal and disposal. This should be detailed and included in the Construction Phase Plan (CPP) and approved by the Principal Designer, before any works are undertaken.

The Department for Education (DfE) confirmed that it will be providing funding to local authorities to coordinate a programme that provides healthy food and enriching activities to eligible children during the Easter, Summer and Christmas Holidays for the next three years starting April 2025. Central Bedfordshire Council has been allocated funding to support over 7,000 children per year who receive free school meals. Full details of the HAF programme can be found on the Gov.uk website. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/holiday-activities-and-food-programme 
      Research has shown that the school holidays can be pressure points for some families. For some children this can lead to a holiday experience gap, with children from low-income households being:
      •	less likely to access organised out-of-school activities.
      •	more likely to experience 'unhealthy holidays' in terms of nutrition and physical health.
      •	more likely to experience social isolation.
      The HAF programme is a response to this issue, with evidence showing that free holiday clubs can have a positive impact on children and young people, and that they work best when they:
      •	provide consistent and easily accessible enrichment activities.
      •	cover more than just breakfast or lunch.
      •	involve children (and parents) in food preparation.
      •	use local partnerships and connections, particularly with the voluntary and community organisation sector.
      This specification is for activities to run during the designated school holidays as indicated by the DfE for the three financial years starting from April 2025. All children who are in school year R (Reception) up to year 11 who attend a school in Central Bedfordshire and who receive benefits related Free School Meals will be eligible to attend a holiday programme in Central Bedfordshire. To provide the high-quality enriching activities to our pupils, Central Bedfordshire Council are seeking to engage with suitably qualified and experienced organisations to provide well organised fully inclusive multi-sport, creative, and enriching holiday club activity camps in various locations across the authority for eligible children and young people within this age range. Clubs should be accessible for all children and young people that meet the criteria including those with additional special educational needs and/or disabilities (SEND)

Through pull finance, this facility will support innovation, scale up and market building for climate change mitigation solutions for developing country contexts, focusing on innovative clean energy technologies and business models in a small number of specific applications/sectors, where the evidence shows support is most needed.

In public innovation financing, ""pull mechanisms"" create incentives for innovators and other actors by creating viable market demand. They seek to reduce viability gaps and induce innovation by signalling demand for solutions to specific problems. Mechanisms often cited include Advanced Market Commitments, Results or Outcomes Based Financing, Prizes/Challenges, innovation bulk procurements, Contracts for Difference, among others. By contrast, much innovation support has to date utilised ""push mechanisms"" directly subsidising up-front R&D costs.

In terms of climate mitigation solutions, the CIPF will support the development of innovation projects aligned to Ayrton Fund themes: industrial decarbonisation, sustainable cooling, smart energy systems and storage and clean transport Further details of Ayrton Fund thematic challenges are set out on gov.uk.

The procurement of this requirement will be in two parts:
(i) A contract for a Facility Manager to manage the programme and identify, incubate, commission and oversee 6-10 climate pull projects of £10m - £50m each. This contract will also cover programme monitoring and learning.

ii) A separate contract for an Independent Evaluator of the programme, who will conduct a mid-term and end-of-term evaluation of the programme&apos;s achievement of its development objectives, theory of change and value for money. This procurement is subject to a separate procurement procedure.

The procurement for the Facility Manager is the focus of this notice and will be run as a competitive procedure with negotiation. The initial contract value is £183m over 5.5 years with options to extend by up to £317m and up to 3 additional years.

The DPS will be used as the mechanism to procure services by entering into calls for competition with providers on the DPS. In accordance with The Public Contract Regulations 2015, Regulation 34 (28(a)), Wigan Council is extending the DPS originally advertised in The Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) with reference number 2015/S 078-138444 and extended by notices 2019/S 093-224781 and 2023/S 000-017392. For indicative purposes, the DPS will be extended until 23rd February 2029. Providers already on the DPS do not need to reapply as they will automatically remain on the DPS. Within this Contracts Finder notice a 'closing date' and 'contract start date' have had to be provided; interested applicants may however apply to join the DPS at any time during its period of validity.

Transport services to be provided under the DPS include home to school transport for children with special educational needs, home to college transport for young adults with special educational needs, and adult social care transport. Services may be required on a daily, weekly, fortnightly or term time only basis for young people attending special educational needs schools, mainstream schools, mainstream colleges, alternative and complementary education and residential services, and respite care; and for adults attending day care facilities owned and managed by Wigan Council, community interest companies and respite care. Clients using the service may be vulnerable and suffer from learning disabilities, behavioural problems, sensory or hearing difficulties, autistic spectrum disorder or another physical disability. Therefore, some journeys will require that a Passenger Assistant be provided by Wigan Council to accompany them.

In order to meet the variety of transport needs contractors must be able to provide as a minimum one of the following vehicle options to be considered for admittance to the DPS: (i) Standard Car (up to four seats); (ii) Accessible Taxi; (iii) Black Cab; (iv) Minibus (up to eight seats); (v) Minibus (sixteen seats); (vi) Tail Lift Vehicle (minimum of 300kg tail lift required); and, (vii) Coach.

The DPS will be used as the mechanism through which Wigan Council will procure home to school and adult social care transportation services and it will be used as a basis to enter into calls for competition with providers on the DPS. Individual contracts raised under the DPS may commence at any time and will depend on the local circumstances of Wigan Council. It is however envisaged that the majority of the home to school contracts will run from the beginning of the Autumn term until the end of the academic year in which they are awarded.

Retail outlets in areas open to the public can contribute to income but operation of these facilities is not a core competence of Public Sector organisations.  Leasing the space to a commercial organisation could deliver better value than the current utilisation and reduce administration costs for the Public Sector while providing an enhanced service user experience.

Public Sector organisations also have an ongoing duty to demonstrate that they achieve best value from their contracts.  Open competition, conducted under transparent rules between suppliers that have already demonstrated competence and compliance with public sector standards, through their appointment to the proposed DPS, is an effective way to show that a Public Sector organisation has met this duty.

The proposed Dynamic Purchasing System will offer a consistent and straightforward route for Public Sector organisations to conduct, and for suppliers to enter, a competition to award a lease contract to the most economically advantageous bidder from a list of qualified suppliers.  The Dynamic Purchasing System will act to reduce friction in the procurement process and ensure that all parties have a clear and consistent view of the contract heads of terms that will apply.

Contracts for the acquisition or rental, by whatever financial means, of land, existing buildings or other immovable property, or which concern interests in or rights over any of them are excluded from the Public Contracts Regulations.  In order to provide a consistent, straightforward and familiar process for Public Sector organisations, this Dynamic Purchasing System will voluntarily follow the set-up processes and structure of a DPS as set out in regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations but is not bound by those Regulations.

Dorset Council reserves the right to terminate the DPS prior to 30 April 2027, and also reserves the right to extend the DPS further beyond 30 April 2027, up to a maximum end date of February 2029 in line with Cabinet Office guidance regarding Dynamic Purchasing Systems procured under PCR2015.

Lot 2 : covers demand responsive transport and other non-typical bus provision.
Note: The DPS excludes the provision of home to school transport for pupils with special transport requirements, e.g. wheelchair and/or passenger assistant.

The Council has a duty under the 1985 Transport Act 'to secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as the council consider it appropriate to secure to meet any public transport requirements ... which would not in its view be met apart from any action taken by it for that purpose.'
The agreement will provide the structure to procure routes, the Bus Strategy developed during 2020 defines what the Council deems appropriate under the Act, and the call offs under this framework will procure those routes, ensuring by the appropriate qualitative criteria that any route details put forward by operators fulfil the requirements defined in the Strategy.
As of June 2022 the Council provides 9 subsidised public bus services operating Mon-Sat with three of these services also operating late into the evening and on Sundays. The Council also contributes to a route procured by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead.

A number of public sector bodies are also responsible for energy efficiency initiatives. These authorities have a duty to promote and implement energy efficiency measures under various national and local schemes aimed at reducing carbon emissions and lowering energy costs for residents. The main purpose of this procurement is to facilitate Energy Efficiency measures through a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS). This system is designed to support local authorities and their partners in accessing energy-efficient products, works, and services. It aims to enhance the energy performance of buildings, contributing to broader environmental and economic objectives such as carbon reduction, economic revitalisation, and public health improvement. The DPS will cover a comprehensive range of energy efficiency categories, allowing for flexible and cost-effective procurement processes that align with available funding streams, including the Warm Homes Local Grant, Local Authority Delivery scheme, the Home Upgrade Grant, and the Energy Company Obligation. This approach enables the continuous improvement of energy efficiency, ensuring that public sector bodies can respond dynamically to emerging needs and opportunities in the energy sector.

The Council currently spends approximately £6,100,000 per annum on LD day services and opportunities which currently support 305 residents. The total Open Framework Agreement value is currently estimated to be £6.1m per annum, £48.8m over the 8-year term. This is based on current contracted activity so actual spend may fall below or above these estimated figures.
      
      Learning disability day opportunity services available on the Open Framework Agreement will enable people with a learning disability to learn new skills, take part in meaningful activities which are outcomes focused, build relationships, and improve health and wellbeing outside of their home environment. They also provide families and carers with time to undertake tasks not possible whilst fulfilling a carer role, such as allowing family members to work, other essential living or alternative carer tasks. 
      
      The provision of Learning Disabilities Day Opportunity Services is to support people to achieve meaningful life outcomes based around four key outcome areas; Health, Independence, Community, and Employment. This outcome focus also supports long term efficiencies as people become healthier, more independent and are supported to both contribute to, and gain support from, their communities. 
      
      This opportunity is open to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and micro providers (for example a provider could apply to support 1 or 2 clients) as well as larger regional and national providers. In establishing this Open Framework Agreement, the council are aiming to create a diverse and varied 'high-street' of services and opportunities for individuals to access.
      
      The Open Framework Agreement will be operational for a period of 8 years from 1st November 2024 to 31st October 2032. Providers will be able to apply to join, or add new services to, the Open Framework Agreement any time during the 8-year framework period. Although the Open Framework Agreement will remain open to applications, these will only be viewed and assessed twice per year for entry in April and October each year.
      
      There will be no limit to the number of providers who can join the Open Framework Agreement throughout its duration. However, the Council reserves the right to close the Open Framework Agreement to new entrants at any time, giving 3 months' notice via a Modification Notice to the original Find a Tender Service Contract Notice and updating the framework advert on both Contracts Finder and the council's e-sourcing system. Closure may be on a temporary or permanent basis and will be clearly stated in the updated notices and adverts.

Mauritius is one of seven Pioneer Countries which aims to address these inadequacies though a national-level structured programme of interventions. Since 2023, the Government of Mauritius and the UK, as anchor donor of the trial, work in partnership to mobilise finance, strengthen climate policy, drive capacity building and manage inclusive platforms to coordinate climate finance activities.

The Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office is exploring options on how to deliver and manage Taskforce deliverables and is seeking input from the market. Deliverables may include technical assistance, management of a Climate Finance Stakeholders Platform and the design and operationalisation of a Climate Finance Unit.

This Agency is required to have a 'good' or ""outstanding"" CQC inspection rating - or as a minimum, 'requires improvement' and be able to demonstrate that action is being taken to address the 'requires improvement' inspection rating.

The EDAPL will enable the procurement of services from external providers to support the Council's Education Division's objective of driving improvements in East Sussex schools, academies, colleges and other educational settings. 
The contract start date is 01 October 2024 and the contract end date is 30 September 2028. Applications are welcome at any time. The Contracts Finder notice template will not allow the submission date to be after the contract start date, hence why the dates above differ. Please go by the dates in this description. 
If Applicants will only be able to work virtually, please note that the Education Division would like someone to be able to work in a hybrid capacity. 

For those not based in the U.K. there is a concern that if individuals have not had experience in working in a school in the UK, they may not have the appropriate knowledge (of UK school governance structures, or UK school curriculum and assessment), or qualifications required for the roles, and therefore wouldn't be able to support the schools effectively.

The Division is seeking consultants and providers who can deliver on any, or all, of the following areas:
      (i) Provide training and support to schools and settings to improve outcomes for all pupils, including support for: leadership, interim leadership support, governance, staff development, curriculum development, moderation and assessment, pedagogy, behaviour, and attendance.
      (ii) Undertake roles associated with the local authority's statutory powers of intervention as outlined in the Department for Education's Schools Causing Concern Guidance (as updated).
      (iii) Undertake reviews and provide challenge and support to leaders and managers in educational settings and across local partnerships.
      (iv) Independent chair roles, and interim governance roles, to support the development of a range of education partnerships.
      (iv) Provide support to identified schools and settings to ensure effective safeguarding arrangements.
      (v) Research and evaluation of effective practice and development of new models and approaches across the range of the Division's work and priorities.
      (vi) Support for the development and implementation of new strategies. 
      (vii) Project and leadership support across the range of the Division's work and priorities.
      
      There will be no cap on the number of Approved Providers, who can apply at any time, and more than once, until they are successful. It is anticipated that the annual aggregate expenditure under the EDAPL will be up to £1,000,000.

The scope will cover all Special Projects requirements. This DPS may then be used to conduct mini competitions for future requirements. Contractors should be aware that being permitted onto this DPS is not a guarantee of any work.

A Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) is a specific type of procurement agreement outlined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (PCR 2015). This is a set of legal requirements which governs how we can buy goods and services and works from suppliers to ensure fairness and value for money. It offers a flexible and efficient way for Public Sector bodies to access pre-qualified suppliers for commonly used goods, services, or works.

A DPS effectively puts Contractors on an approved supplier list for the types of work they can do in the
area that they can do it.

A DPS is a flexible way for organisations who are covered by the Regulations to select from a list of approved suppliers for specific services that they buy regularly. 

By having a DPS, Orbit can streamline the procurement process for all requirements that would fall under the named Lots within the DPS so that, once suppliers are qualified, they do not have to demonstrate their suitability and capability every time they wish to compete for a contract. This makes the award of individual contracts faster than it would otherwise be without the DPS.

Lots to be included:

Lot 1 - Resurfacing - Repairs or Replacement
Lot 2 - Structural (Subsidence)
Lot 3 - Drainage & Associated Works
Lot 4 - External Fabric Wall & Coverings - Repair or Replacement
Lot 5 - Fencing & Boundaries - Repair or Replacement
Lot 6 - Flat or Pitched Roofing - Repairs or Replacement
Lot 7 - Windows & Doors - Replacement Roofline (soffits/fascia/rainwater goods)
Lot 8 - Communal Floor Coverings - Repair or Replacement
Lot 9 - General Construction Works (Multi Discipline) - Small to Medium

A Construction & Asset Upgrade / Reinvestment Works DPS to cover all Special Projects that cannot or should not be covered any other existing contracts, either due to it falling outside of areas of expertise or due to capacity. 

The estimated annual value of all lots combined is £4M, £20M over the proposed initial 5 year term.

The contract will cover construction, maintenance and resultant remedial small scope high impact works to the MoJ estate. In the main, this includes prison establishments but may also include courts, tribunals, Home Office controlled and corporate buildings.

The MWDPS will also be made available for use by Gov. Facility Services Limited, a MoJ wholly owned company responsible for the total facilities management of 48 prisons across the South of England, to source subcontractors to support its maintenance and project activities
. 
Call-off contracts let under the MWDPS will have a maximum contract value of £1,000,000 GBP, however we expect the majority of projects to have a contract value of <£500,000 GBP. 

The procurement will be undertaken in accordance with Regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.

 The MWDPS will operate across England, Wales and Scotland and is divided into four (4) headline Lots:-
-	FM Maintenance Services
-	Project & Construction Works
-	System/Asset Procurement & Installation
-	Specialist/Miscellaneous Requirements


Each of the Lots are further subdivided into Categories.

There is a desire to attract a broad range of Contractors to be part of the MWDPS.  The number of Contractors appointed to the MWDPS is unlimited.
 
The MWDPS will initially be in operation for Four (4) years with an option to extend for a further two (2), two (2) year terms, at the sole discretion of the Authority, making a total of eight (8) years.  However, the duration may be varied (reduced or extended) in line with emerging business needs
.
The estimated spend for the first 4 years of the MWDPS is £296,000,000 GBP (£74,000,000 GPB per annum made up of £64,000,000 GBP per annum for project work and £10,000,000 per annum for maintenance related activity).

The MWDPS, in itself, is not a works contract.  Call Off Competitions will be held under the MWDPS for specific Projects or maintenance contracts.

20230918103317-104118,Contract,"Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council",Open,2023-09-18T10:33:24+01:00,"Supported Living FPS","The Council is seeking applications from providers who may wish to join the Supported Living: Flexible Purchasing System (FPS). The intention is to appoint a range of providers with the capability and capacity to deliver Care and Support in a supported living setting.
Once the FPS is established, contracts will be awarded either by running mini competitions or via direct awards. 

The main principles of supported living are that people with learning disabilities own or rent their home and have control over the support they get, who they live with (if anyone) and how they live their lives. Supported living assumes that all people with learning disabilities, regardless of the level or type of disability, can make choices about how to live their lives.

Rotherham's population for people with a learning disability and autistic people is changing both in complexity and with an ageing population. Often people remain in provisions with limited move-on opportunities to their own tenancy.

There is a lack of specialist autism provision too. In drafting Rotherham's Autism Strategy, autistic people indicated that they needed housing which could accommodate sensory needs with acoustic/noise reduction. As one autistic person said: Home needs to be the place ""where we can relax, unwind, and work off that stress"".    

Supported living is a service designed to help people with a wide range of support needs retain their independence by being supported in their own home. People in supported living have their own tenancy and are responsible for their own bills and cost of living. To afford these, the person may be entitled to a wide range of benefits and grants. In single-person-supported living, they will also have their own front door. In Supported Living, the support provided is not dependent on the provision of housing (and vice versa) so if the support provider changes, this doesn't affect the tenancy.  The person has the security of tenure in line with their tenancy agreement. 

The Council has a need to work with high quality supported living provision across the borough and establish a model which will enable the following: -

•	A flexible approach to engage with multiple suppliers in the market
•	Cost Savings through increased competition
•	Opportunity to stimulate development in the Supported Living Market
•	Potential to increase access for Rotherham's small-medium enterprises
•	Support the delivery of Rotherham Council's social value ambition",,"S60 1AE","Any region","85000000 85300000 85310000 85311000 85320000 ","Yvonne Dutton",yvonne.dutton@rotherham.gov.uk,"Riverside House","Main Street",Rotherham,"S60 1AE",ENG,'+441709334165,https://www.rotherham.gov.uk/,,"https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/Company/CompanyInformation/Index/104118 ","Additional Information - Annual Estimated Spend

Part I The overarching 10 year framework will open and detail specific lots. At this stage providers need to meet the minimum entry criteria, this is detailed when the framework is open. At this stage providers will be asked to complete minimum entry criteria for the Lots they may in future wish to participate in further competitions for. 
In Part 2 providers will be invited further competition which will include further quality / price evaluation processes in respect of specific call off. It is anticipated that this process will commence from April 2022.

The routes are listed on the left hand side of the Institute for Apprenticeships & Technical Education' website:

YPO will list all routes, along with standards which are approved for delivery, and providers will have the ability to select which standards region they are able to deliver in when bidding for the framework. 

The routes will be as listed by the Institute for Apprenticeships & Technical Education guidance.
